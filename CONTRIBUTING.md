# Contributing Guidelines: QAT Library
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a contributor

Please note, this library was not developed to achieve complex REST API test automation flow, rather, it is focused
more towards a lightweight, no-coding required, data-driven automated REST API test automation solution. Although, this
may change as we grow, we'd always like to keep our code lightweight and easy to use. We can always add more Robot
Framework keywords to provide enhanced capabilities in Scripted Test Automation flow.  

## Report bugs or enhancement request at QATLibrary's [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sharif314/QATLibrary/issues)
We use Jira issues to track feature requests or bugs.
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/sharif314/QATLibrary/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase
(we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)).
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Increase the version numbers in any examples files, and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [CalVer](https://calver.org/). Format is yy.mm.minor.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, configurations or schema change.
3. All changes must be backward compatible (unless absolutely avoidable) or discussed ahead of implementation.
4. Make sure no sensitive data or credential is present anywhere in the code or configurations.
5. Issue that pull request!
6. All Pull Requests are merged with 'Squash and Merge' strategy.


## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a
bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code/logs if you can. [This stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626)
      includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Keep consistent naming convention as per the project's current setup.
* General Python best practices.
* No sensitive data or credentials at code.
* Only use well documented and maintained open source libraries.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the maintainers. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
